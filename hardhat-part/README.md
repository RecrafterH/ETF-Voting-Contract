# ETF Voting Contract

The hardhat part of this project consists of 4 different contracts, unit tests and a deploy script.

The main focus is on the Voting Contract and the ETF Token, which is part of the Ecosystem. The DummyToken and the Marketplace are helper contracts to present the functionality of the ETF contract. For this reason, the helper contracts are also kept quite simple.
