## ETF Frontend

It is a simple front-end with a user interface that allows users to interact with the contract. There are a couple of different pages. One for the ETF voting contract so the user can send a proposal and vote. Another page where the user can buy ETF tokens, and a few more pages to give the feel of a normal website. 


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
